Hello! Welcome to my blog. My interest is mainly in computer security, although I will also post about my work in other areas, and perhaps even the occasional personal post. Feel free to go through the projects listed on this website or skip directly to my Github profile. 
I don’t know how long I’ll maintain this blog, so let’s find out, shall we?
